> I had to write two essays for my masters applications for grad-school. I figured I should make them public since it will make me take the process more seriously, and future applicants may benefit from reading them. Here is the first one: 

<!-- 
My story --like everyone else's-- starts from a state of ignorance. It's easy to forget our humble beginnings given all the progress we've made, but rewind your own clock even a hundred generations, and you'll meet someone who knows embarrassingly little about the universe; just scarcely getting by. One shudders to think where we'll be a hundred generations from now.

On a smaller scale, I like to think my story is still one of progress.  -->

I'd like to think my story is one of progress. While immigrating to Canada from India, I moved homes over six times, and spent quite a bit of time away from my parents. For a child, moving often and unexpectedly can erode the sense of permanence and safety typically found in a home. 
My refuge, was my imagination. I lost myself in books in India; whereas with Canada it was the internet. I couldn't believe how much stuff there was on Wikipedia, KhanAcademy, and YouTube. I loved the freedom of it. Of course, that didn't translate to good grades, and even today I'd rather show off my [400,000 points][]{:target="_blank"} on KhanAcademy over my highschool transcript.

University wasn't that different at first. I spent an unhappy year studying finance, almost flunking out, and I couldn't afford the costs of the downtown campus. I had worked summers for a property maintenance company going door-to-door selling their driveway sealing services; ending each day exhausted and covered [head-to-toe][]{:target="_blank"} in tar. It paid well, but not enough to be re-taking courses. Switching campuses took some pressure off, and switching programs gave back to me the sense of freedom I had missed so dearly. Computer Science had me falling in love with learning all over again.

For the next three years, I was like a sponge absorbing all the CS and Math classes I could find. I went to every single one of my professor's office hours and eventually landed myself a TA position, which polished my communication skills and showed me a different perspective on the classroom. In my third year, I took six courses each semester while also working as a TA. It was by far my toughest and best year academically, with all 'A's and the highest mark in one of my courses. I learned a lot that year, not just about machine learning and robotics, but also about things like discipline and perseverance. After this came an internship at the Robotics Evaluation Team at EPSON, where I automated away several bottlenecks in their evaluation pipeline and learned a ton about working with bin picking robots. 



Something I want to make clear is that I did none of this alone. I was always surrounded by the most amazing friends and professors who inspired me to bring my best work to the table every single day. Also my family who supported me throughout; from helping with tuition to sending me hugs and home cooked food.



In my fourth year, my friends and I founded the [UTM Robotics Club][]{:target="_blank"}, and I was elected VP of Internal Affairs of the [MCS Society][]{:target="_blank"}. Between those two organizations we coordinated and held over 50 events on campus. I personally ran ML workshops for the Robotics Club; resume workshops and games nights' for MCSS. It was an incredibly rewarding experience, and it made realize that I wasn't done with university just yet.

I decided I wanted to pursue graduate studies and immediately began looking for opportunities to gain research experience. Upon graduation, I received my department's NSERC [Undergraduate Student Research Award][]{:target="_blank"}; which funded my work on a [research project][]{:target="_blank"} in robotics safety analysis supervised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti][]{:target="_blank"}. I have since started work on another project, with the goal of submitting to ICRA in October. I faced more than a few challenges in my university career, and to me that reward represents, more than anything, the overcoming of those challenges. During moments of doubt it's a salient reminder to pick myself up, dust off and continue.

<!-- On a smaller scale, I still like to think my story is one of progress. My family comes from rural Gujarat, in India. We went through some hard times when my grandfather suddenly passed away at 52. My father was about to start a career in film at the time, but put that on hold to take over the family business -- all while also caring for his mother and two younger siblings. My mother faced her own challenges growing up; as a young woman in a conservative household, she had to fight for her education and independence. Facing adversity, my parents were each steadfast in their resolve. Today, my mother possesses degrees in psychology (B.S & M.S.), business & marketing (MBA), and is currently pursuing a license to start work as an immigration consultant. Meanwhile my dad proudly looks back on a long and award-winning career as a director.

If they did, we sealed their driveway on the spot. We got paid a commission for each sale and that meant I made more than minimum wage if I did well. 


, even though there were days where I made nothing.

there were days where I made nothing, but on average it was more than minimum wage, which was enough spending money for highschool, but not downtown Toronto.

## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) is work in progress, so it does not support the full range of math expressions as, say, [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
Yet, it is [blazing fast](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

***

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

***

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div> -->
