I am currently a robotics researcher at the [Robotics Vision & Learning Lab][]{:target="_blank"} at the [University of Toronto][]{:target="_blank"}, and actively seeking software engineering or research roles in robotics and/or machine learning.

If you have any such opportunities available please email me at ali.kuwajerwala@mail.utoronto.ca

Previously I worked as a Software Developer at [Epson Canada] and a Teaching Assistant at the University of Toronto, where I also completed my Bachelors Degree, majoring in Computer Science and Math.

I've been fascinated by science and technology for as long as I can remember. 


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
