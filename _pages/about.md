Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a researcher and software engineer specializing in robotics and machine learning. Currently, I am a masters student at [UdeM][]{:target="_blank"} and [Mila][]{:target="_blank"}.

[UdeM]: https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/
[Mila]: https://mila.quebec/

I just completed my position as researcher at the [Robotics Vision & Learning Lab][]{:target="_blank"} at the [University of Toronto][]{:target="_blank"}, and I am **actively seeking software engineering or research roles at this time**.
**You can find my resume [here][]{:target="_blank"}.**

**If you have any such opportunities available please email me at ali.kuwajerwala@mail.utoronto.ca**

Previously I worked as a Software Developer at [Epson Canada][]{:target="_blank"} and a Teaching Assistant at the University of Toronto [Computer Science Department][]{:target="_blank"}, where I also completed my Bachelors Degree, majoring in Computer Science and Math. 

Upon graduating I received the [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award][]{:target="_blank"} which funded my current research where I was supervised by [Prof. Florian Shkurti][]{:target="_blank"}.

My research/career interests lie within machine learning and robotics, specifically I have worked on several projects ranging from [safety analysis for autonomous systems][]{:target="_blank"}; [autonomous driving][]{:target="_blank"}; [reinforcement learning][]{:target="_blank"}; to [neural network interpretability][]{:target="_blank"}. I also make [android apps][]{:target="_blank"}, and you can view all my projects on my [github profile][]{:target="_blank"}.

When I'm not staring at a screen all day, I like reading non-fiction, meditation, juggling, and travel.
