        <p>A short essay on my research interests and career goals.</p>
      </d-title>

      <d-byline></d-byline>

      <d-article>
        <blockquote>
  <p>I had to write two essays about myself for my masters applications for grad-school. I figured I should make them public since future applicants may benefit from reading them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is the second one, which talks about why I want to pursue a masters degree and a career in research.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Robotics research is making huge progress. However,  -->
<p>There are still a number of challenges to be overcome before robots can become truly ubiquitous in everyday life.
The same can be said of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and other methods in machine learning.
Mobile robot systems (MRS) will need to operate in unknown environments, and interact with humans as well as other robots; and they must do so safely, without the risk of injury or property damage. Likewise, ANNs will need to at least be interpretable before they can be put in charge of any safety critical systems, such as mobile robots. I believe these two problems are complementary and my research goals lie at their intersection.</p>

<p>During highschool, I worked summers for a property maintenance company going door-to-door selling driveway sealing services, ending each day exhausted and covered head-to-toe in tar. Not only was it a stellar education in grit and perseverance; it also gave me a glimpse of the unsafe and arduous labour that many jobs today entail. Long erratic hours, toxic fumes, and hefty tar-covered equipment are simply orthogonal to one’s well being in the long term. Much of this type of work can be eliminated with serious progress in machine learning and robotics. During my masters, I would like to make some of that progress right here at UofT.</p>

<!-- 
I thoroughly enjoyed that job, and it was by far the best education I've received

It was by far the best education I've ever received


My journey towards a research career has been 

My family moved to Canada when I was just starting highschool. It was q

My journey I was on the fence about pursuing a research career until about six months ago. 


Although I am open to a variety of research within  -->

<!-- 
My story --like everyone else's-- starts from a state of ignorance. It's easy to forget our humble beginnings given all the progress we've made, but rewind your own clock even a hundred generations, and you'll meet someone who knows embarrassingly little about the universe; just scarcely getting by. One shudders to think where we'll be a hundred generations from now.

On a smaller scale, I like to think my story is still one of progress.  -->

<!-- &nbsp; -->

<p>I like to think of my story as one of progress.</p>

<p>While immigrating I moved homes over six times, and spent quite some time away from my parents. At a young age, such disruptions can erode the sense of permanence and safety typically found in a home. 
My refuge was my imagination. I lost myself in books in India; whereas with Canada it was the internet. I couldn’t believe how much stuff there was on Wikipedia, KhanAcademy, and YouTube. I loved the freedom of it. Unfortunately, that didn’t translate to good grades and even today I’d rather show off my <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/aliqk1603/" target="_blank">400,000 points</a> on KhanAcademy over my highschool transcript.</p>

<p>University of Toronto wasn’t different at first. I spent an unhappy year studying finance, almost flunking out, and I couldn’t afford the costs of the downtown campus. I had worked summers for a property maintenance company going door-to-door selling driveway sealing services, ending each day exhausted and covered <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WGpdLac" target="_blank">head-to-toe</a> in tar. It paid well, but not enough to risk re-taking courses. Switching to the Mississauga campus helped; but it was switching programs to computer science that gave me my sense of freedom again.</p>

<p>Over the next three years, I was like a sponge absorbing every CS and Math course I could find. 
<!-- I went to all of my professor's office hours, and was offered a TA position which helped me polish my communication skills.  -->
I devoured audiobooks during my commute and went to all the professor’s office hours. 
In third year I took six courses each semester while also working as a TA. It was by far my toughest and best year academically, with all ‘A’s and the highest mark in one of my courses. I learned a lot that year, not just about machine learning and cryptography; but also about things like discipline and perseverance. 
<!-- I also started to seriously pursue robotics,  -->
Later during my internship at EPSON’s Robotics Department, I worked with bin picking robots and realized just how much unsafe and unnecessary labour, such as driveway sealing, the world could eliminate by making progress on the machine learning systems used by autonomous robots.</p>

<!-- making progress on the adaptability  -->

<!-- Something I want to make clear is that I did none of this alone. -->

<p>My senior year I was a founder of the <a href="https://utmrobotics.com/" target="_blank">UTM Robotics Club</a> and elected to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/utmmcss/" target="_blank">MCS Society</a>. Between those organizations we coordinated and held over 50 events on campus. I personally designed and ran workshops on neural network interpretability and deep Q learning; 
and we started work on several long-term projects like using robot cars to collect garbage on campus.
It was a thoroughly rewarding experience that made me realize I truly wanted a career in research.
Upon graduation, I received my department’s NSERC <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp" target="_blank">Undergraduate Student Research Award</a> which funded my <a href="https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/backwards-reachability/" target="_blank">work</a> on reachability analysis at the ‘Robotics, Vision and Learning Lab’ at UTM; attempting to provide safety guarantees for autonomous robot systems. I have since started work there on another research project, with the goal of submitting to RA-L in November.</p>

<p>I want to stress that I did none of this alone. 
I was always surrounded by the most amazing friends and faculty who inspired me to bring my best work to campus every single day. 
Also my family who supported me throughout; from helping with tuition to sending me hugs and home cooked food.</p>

<!-- I faced more than a few challenges during my university career, and to me that research award represents, more than anything, my progress.  -->

<p>I think during university, what drove my success was the freedom I found in allowing myself to be a work in progress. Even today during moments of doubt, it’s a salient reminder to pick myself up, dust off, and continue. 
With my master’s, I want to pursue research towards making deep learning models more interpretable and autonomous robot systems safer.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering my application, and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<!-- On a smaller scale, I still like to think my story is one of progress. My family comes from rural Gujarat, in India. We went through some hard times when my grandfather suddenly passed away at 52. My father was about to start a career in film at the time, but put that on hold to take over the family business -- all while also caring for his mother and two younger siblings. My mother faced her own challenges growing up; as a young woman in a conservative household, she had to fight for her education and independence. Facing adversity, my parents were each steadfast in their resolve. Today, my mother possesses degrees in psychology (B.S & M.S.), business & marketing (MBA), and is currently pursuing a license to start work as an immigration consultant. Meanwhile my dad proudly looks back on a long and award-winning career as a director.

If they did, we sealed their driveway on the spot. We got paid a commission for each sale and that meant I made more than minimum wage if I did well.

## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) is work in progress, so it does not support the full range of math expressions as, say, [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
Yet, it is [blazing fast](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

***

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

***

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div> -->
